Jack and Plack, two friends, arrive at a city called Dog Hill where the royal steward, Count Mortadella, rules. The Count, a man of great beauty despite his odd features, has a strange habit of closing one eye and wearing a black band over it. The city is preparing for a grand sports event, and everyone, including Jack and Plack, is eager to participate to win a coveted prize. They come up with a plan to enter the race by pretending to have humps like everyone else in the city. As they sneak into the city, they marvel at the preparations and the sight of all the hunchbacked people. The story ends with an air of mystery as they plan to meet again the next evening.
